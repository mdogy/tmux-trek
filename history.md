# Project History

## 2026-06-08

The vertical slice expanded from session basics into compact playable Act 2 and Act 3 prototypes:

- Act 2 added Ensign Redshirt's rescue using `Ctrl+b c`, `Ctrl+b w`, and `Ctrl+b p`.
- Act 3 added Commander Sock's scanner using `Ctrl+b %`, `Ctrl+b "`, and `Ctrl+b x`.
- `SessionManager` and `TmuxEngine` gained deterministic window and pane state operations.
- Redshirt and Sock received distinct generated character textures, dialogue, map positions, and progression steps.
- Unit, BDD, and keyboard-only Playwright coverage expanded through the end of Act 3.
- PR [#12](https://github.com/mdogy/tmux-trek/pull/12) passed CI, merged to `main`, and deployed to GitHub Pages.

Documentation was then consolidated for context-free session resumption:

- `doc/session-handoff.md` became the current implementation and resume source of truth.
- README, TODO, history, gameplay, delivery, engineering, asset, and contributor docs were synchronized.
- Preserved research and autonomous prompts were explicitly labeled as references rather than current instructions.
- PR and feature templates gained resume-documentation checks.

The immediately preceding gameplay/art pass also:

- made NPCs and the beacon solid collision objects
- required horizontal adjacency and a visible highlight before `E` interaction
- added useful "nothing to say yet" feedback for inactive characters
- built the crater from terrain tiles and replaced square actor markers with distinct sprites
- integrated the generated `z-shell-terrain.png` runtime atlas
- standardized PR CI and GitHub Pages deployment

The project reached a cleaner playable prototype state:

- GitHub Pages deployment was fixed by correcting the production asset base path.
- Tile movement, obstacle collisions, and a legible CLULIX beacon were added.
- Browser regression tests covered movement, focus handoff, proximity prompts, and the Zrix-to-Vrex flow.
- GitHub Issues and `TODO.md` were established as roadmap surfaces.

TMUX Trek began as a planning bundle and was normalized into a runnable project:

- Vite, Phaser, xterm.js, Vitest, Cucumber, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and commitlint were configured.
- Source, tests, features, active docs, and preserved research were separated into maintainable directories.
- Development began with a session-focused educational vertical slice.

## Preserved Source Material

Active documents live in `doc/`. Historical research, autonomous prompts, and asset prompts live in `docs/`. Those reference files may describe aspirational architecture or obsolete workflows; use [Session Handoff](doc/session-handoff.md) for current truth.
